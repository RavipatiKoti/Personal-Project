Docker is container-based application framework, which wraps a specific application with all its dependencies in a container. Docker containers can easily to ship to the remote location on start there without making entire application setup. This tutorial will help you to install Docker on Ubuntu 18.10, 18.04 LTS, and 16.04 LTS

1. Prerequsites
The very first step is to remove any default Docker packages from the system before installation Docker on a Linux VPS. Execute commands to remove unnecessary Docker versions.

sudo apt-get purge docker lxc-docker docker-engine docker.io
Now install some required packages on your system for installing Docker on Ubuntu system. Run the below commands to do this:

sudo apt-get install  curl  apt-transport-https ca-certificates software-properties-common
2. Setup Docker Repository
Now import dockers official GPG key to verify packages signature before installing them with apt-get. Run the below command on terminal.

curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add 
After that add the Docker repository on your Ubuntu system which contains Docker packages including its dependencies. You must have to enable this repository to install Docker on Ubuntu.

sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
3. Install Docker on Ubuntu
Your system is now ready for Docker installation. Run the following commands to upgrade apt index and then install Docker community edition on Ubuntu.

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker-ce
